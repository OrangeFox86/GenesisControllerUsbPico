The code here is meant for the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller. It allows for 2 Sega Genesis
controllers to be plugged in and interface with any USB host device.

Refer to configuration.h for settings that may be modified to configure this however you'd like.
Players 1 and 2 may be set as a keyboard or gamepad devices (gamepad by default). Mapped keys may
also be configured there. Refer to schematic.png for the recommended electronics setup.

The USB device won't connect until at least 1 controller is connected. This is by design as I am
using this in a retropie system - I'd like emulators to select other USB or bluetooth controllers if
I don't have genesis controllers plugged into the system.
