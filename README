Known issues:
- A HID Keyboard only supports 6 keys at a time, and one keyboard is shared with two players - I'm considering on creating an HID keyboard for each player

Things left to do:
- Figure out a good way to remap keys without reprogramming
- Add HID gamepad interface (loose coupling between controller and keyboard objects was intentional to allow for this)
- Add more documentation & YouTube video
- Refactoring and doxygen comments!
